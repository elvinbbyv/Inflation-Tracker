# Inflation-Tracker
Just finished a small Python project: Inflation Tracker. It loads CSV data, cleans it, calculates basic stats, visualizes CPI &amp; inflation trends, and exports cleaned data with a summary report.

This is a small Python project I built to practice working with real data and improve my skills in data analysis and visualization.  

The program loads a CSV file with inflation-related data and lets you:
- See info about the dataset (rows, columns, data types, etc.)
- Calculate basic statistics like mean, median, min, max
- Clean the data (handle missing values, remove duplicates)
- Generate different graphs:
  - Average CPI over years (line chart)
  - Average inflation by country (bar chart)
  - Average unemployment rate over years (bar chart)
- Export the cleaned data and a simple text summary report
- Find the top 5 countries with the highest average annual inflation

## Tools I used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib
